---

## Key Adjustments

- **Ch 10 (Concurrency)** gets 2 days - it's critical and dense
- **Ch 14** can be skimmed initially (advanced/specialized topics)
- **Ch 15 (Generics)** is important for modern Go (1.18+)
- Use any extra time for hands-on coding practice

## Success Tips

1. **Complete Ch 1 setup ASAP** (ideally before starting)
2. **Code every example** - especially Ch 3, 5, 7, 10
3. **Focus on Ch 7 & 10** - these are foundational to idiomatic Go
4. **Use weekends** for catch-up or extra practice
