# Chapter 01 - Setting Up Your Go Environment

For now, I'll assume you are using a Mac and have [homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

These directions will get Go, Visual Studio Code, and the Go extension installed.

```bash
brew install go visual-studio-code
code --install-extension golang.go
```

Install the Go tools next.

Open Visual Studio Code.

Open the Command Palette by pressing Cmd + Shift + P.

Type "Go: Install/Update Tools" and select it from the dropdown list.

A menu will pop up with a list of available tools.
Click the checkbox to the left of the search bar to select all of them.

Click OK. The installation process will begin
You will see output at the bottom of the window showing the installation progress.
